**Bio**  
- 🎓 Education: 2nd Year BS Computer Science Student at The City College of Angeles  
- ⚡ Learner Type: Fast and visual learner  
- ☕ Interests: Reading books, enjoying coffee, and continuous learning  

I’m someone who values growth and happiness over fixed goals. I don’t aim for one single destination in life — instead, I focus on living each day in a way that feels fulfilling and meaningful. I enjoy learning new things quickly, especially through visuals and hands-on experiences. I believe that keeping life balanced with small joys like music, reading, and a good cup of coffee helps me move forward with positivity.
